survival ; the number of months patient survived (has survived,
		  if patient is still alive).  Because all the patients
		  had their heart attacks at different times, it is
		  possible that some patients have survived less than
		  one year but they are still alive.  Check the second
		  variable to confirm this.  Such patients cannot be
		  used for the prediction task mentioned above.
still-alive ; a binary variable.  0=dead at end of survival period,
		     1 means still alive
age-at-heart-attack ; age in years when heart attack occurred
pericardial-effusion ; binary. Pericardial effusion is fluid
		      around the heart.  0=no fluid, 1=fluid
fractional-shortening ; a measure of contracility around the heart
			       lower numbers are increasingly abnormal
epss ; E-point septal separation, another measure of contractility.
	      Larger numbers are increasingly abnormal.
lvdd ; left ventricular end-diastolic dimension.  This is
	      a measure of the size of the heart at end-diastole.
	      Large hearts tend to be sick hearts.
wall-motion-score ; a measure of how the segments of the left
		   ventricle are moving
wall-motion-index ; equals wall-motion-score divided by number of
			   segments seen.  Usually 12-13 segments are seen
			   in an echocardiogram.  Use this variable INSTEAD
			   of the wall motion score.

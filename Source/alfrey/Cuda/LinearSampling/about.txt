This project aims to provide high-performance tools for sampling the graph of linear classifiers and computing combinatorial overfitting bounds.

Description
This project produces two DLLs - LinearSamplingGPU.dll and LinearSamplingCPU.dll. Both DLLs has the same interface (described by ls_api.h). 
GPU-version is implemented in CUDA. The development of CPU-version is possible even without CUDA drivers installed (just unload the GPU-project in Visual Studio).
The code duplication between CPU- and GPU- versinos is keept at minimum (files are reused between projects whenever this is possible).

Note[7-mar-12]: CPU-version is a placeholder, it is missing all key methods which will be added soon.

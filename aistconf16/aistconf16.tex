\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present a new asynchronous algorithm for learning additively regularized topic models
and discuss the main architectural details of our implementation.
The key property of the new algorithm is that it behaves in a fully deterministic fashion,
which is typically hard to achieve in a non-blocking parallel implementation. The algorithm
had been
recently implemented in the BigARTM library (\texttt{http://bigartm.org}).
Our new algorithm is compatible with all features previously introduced in BigARTM library,
including multimodality, regularizers and scores calculation.
While the existing BigARTM implementation compares favorably
with the alternative packages such as Vowpal Wabbit or Gensim,
the new algorithm brings yet further improvements in CPU utilization,
memory usage, and spends even less time to achieve the same perplexity.

\section{Introduction}

% There is plenty of research on distributed implementation of topic models, and less focus on efficient single-node implementation.
% Our implementation is designed to be a building block in a distributed computation.
% Many researchers might not have a budget to access an HPC cluster, and would prefer to run experiments on their local hardware or using a single powerfull EC2 instance.

Deterministic behavior is an important property for any algorithm,
including those of a stochastic nature.
For the end users of a software system run-to-run reproducibility is a must-have property,
because this is what they expect based on their previous experience.
Indeed, refreshing a web-pages or re-doing an operation tend to
produce an identical result, regardless of how much software complexity is hidden behind the scenes.
For the researches determinism is also important
because it enables them to reproduce their old experiments
and study impact of various parameters on the result.
Finally, for the developers of the algorithm
determinism allow to reproduce bugs and write simple unit-tests with well-defined results.

Determinism is particularly hard to achieve
in concurrent implementations, because in a multi-threaded environment
it might not be sufficient to just fix a random seed or an initial approximation.
In this paper we present a deterministic modification of parallel non-blocking algorithm
for online topic modeling, previously developed for BigARTM library.
We implement new algorithm in BigARTM and demonstrate that new version converges faster
than previous algorithm in terms of perplexity,
yet being more efficient in CPU and memory usage.

\section{Notation}
\label{sec:Notation}

Let
$D$ denote a finite set (collection) of texts and
$W$ denote a~finite set (vocabulary) of all terms from these texts.
Let
$n_{dw}$ denote the number of occurrences of a term $w \in W$ in a document $d \in D$;
$n_{dw}$ values form a sparse matrix of size $|W| \times |D|$,
known as \emph{bag-of-words} representation of the collection.

Given an $(n_{dw})$ matrix, an additively-regularized topic model (ARTM) finds two matrices:
$\Phi = \{\phi_{wt}\}$ and $\Theta = \{\theta_{td}\}$,
of sizes $|W| \times |T|$ and $|T| \times |D|$ respectively,
where $|T|$ is a used-defined number of \emph{topics} in the model.
Matrices $\Phi$ and $\Theta$
provide a compressed representation of the $(n_{dw})$ matrix:
\[
n_{dw} \approx n_d \sum_{t \in T} \phi_{wt} \theta_{td}, \text { for all } d \in D, w \in W,
\]
where $n_d = \sum_{w \in W} n_{dw}$ denotes the total number of terms in a document $d$.

To learn $\Phi$ and $\Theta$ from $(n_{dw})$ ARTM maximizes
the log-likelihood, regularized via an additional penalty term $R(\Phi, \Theta)$:
\begin{gather}
\label{eq:ARTM}
    \sum_{d\in D}\sum_{w\in W} n_{dw} \ln \sum_{t\in T} \phi_{wt} \theta_{td} + R(\Phi, \Theta)
    \;\to\; \max_{\Phi,\Theta}.
\end{gather}
With no regularization (${R=0}$) it corresponds to PLSA~\cite{hofmann99plsi}.
Many Bayesian topic models, including LDA~\cite{blei03latent}, can be represented
as special cases of ARTM with different regularizers~$R$,
as shown in~\cite{voron14mlj,voron14aist}.

In \cite{voron14dan-eng} it is shown that the \mbox{local} maximum $(\Phi,\Theta)$
of the problem~\eqref{eq:ARTM} satisfies
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:Estep}
    p_{tdw} &= \norm_{t\in T} \bigl(\phi_{wt}\theta_{td}\bigr);
\\
    \label{eq:Mstep:phi}
    \phi_{wt} &= \norm_{w\in W}
        \biggl(
            \sum_{d\in D} n_{dw} p_{tdw} + \phi_{wt} \frac{\partial R}{\partial \phi_{wt}}
        \biggr);
%    \phi_{wt} &= \norm_{w\in W}
%        \biggl(
%            n_{wt} + r_{wt}
%        \biggr);
%    \quad
%    n_{wt} = \sum_{d\in D} n_{dw} p_{tdw};
%    \quad
%    r_{wt} = \phi_{wt} \frac{\partial R}{\partial \phi_{wt}};
\\
    \label{eq:Mstep:theta}
    \theta_{td} &= \norm_{t\in T}
        \biggl(
            \sum_{w\in d} n_{dw} p_{tdw} + \theta_{td} \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta_{td}}
        \biggr);
%    \theta_{td} &= \norm_{t\in T}
%        \biggl(
%            n_{td} + r_{td}
%        \biggr);
%    \quad
%    n_{td} = \sum_{w\in d} n_{dw} p_{tdw};
%    \quad
%    r_{td} = \theta_{td} \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta_{td}};
        %\sum_{m=1}^M \tau_m \!\!\sum_{w\in W^m}\!\!\! n_{dw} p_{tdw};
\end{align}
where operator
$\norm_{i \in I} x_i = \frac{\max\{x_i,0\}}{\sum\limits_{j\in I} \max\{x_j,0\}}$
transforms a~vector $(x_i)_{i \in I}$ to a~discrete distribution.

Learning of $\Phi$ and $\Theta$ from \eqref{eq:Estep}--\eqref{eq:Mstep:theta} can be done by EM-algorithm,
which starts from a random initial approximation and iterates
E-step \eqref{eq:Estep} and
M-steps \eqref{eq:Mstep:phi},\eqref{eq:Mstep:theta}
until convergence.
In the sequel we discuss several variations of such EM-algorithm,
which are all based on the above formulas but differ in the way how operations are ordered and grouped together.

%In additional to plain text many collections has additional data,
%such as authors, class or category labels, date-time stamps.
%In \cite{vfardy15cikmtm} this data can be represented as \emph{modalities},
%where the overall vocabulary $W$ is split into $M$ subsets
%$W = W^1 \sqcup \dots \sqcup W^M$, one subset per modality,
%and $\Phi$ matrix is normalized independently within each modality:
%\begin{align}
%    \sum_{w \in W^m} \phi_{wt} = 1, \; \text{ for all } t \in T, m = 1, \dots, M \\\notag
%\end{align}

\includegraphics[scale=1]{plots/plot_legend_offline.pdf}
\end{tabular}
\caption{Gantt chart for execution of the Offline algorithm} \label{fig:gantt:offline}
\end{figure}

The algorithm is given by
Fig. \ref{alg:Offline} (\kw{Offline algorithm}) and
Fig. \ref{alg:ProcessDocument} (\kw{ProcessDocument}).

Subroutine \kw{ProcessDocument($d, \Phi$)} corresponds to equations \eqref{eq:Estep} and \eqref{eq:Mstep:theta} from the fixed-point solution of the ARTM optimization problem \eqref{eq:ARTM}.
\kw{ProcessDocument} requires a $\Phi$ matrix
and a vector $n_{dw}$ of term frequencies for a given document $d \in D$,
and as a result it returns the topical distribution $\theta_{td}$ for the document,
and a matrix $(\hat n_{wt})$ of size $|d| \times |T|$,
where $|d|$ gives the number of distinct terms in the document.
The \kw{ProcessDocument} might be also useful as a separate routine which finds $\theta_{td}$ distribution for a new document,
but in the \kw{Offline algorithm} it is rather used as a building block in an iterative EM-algorithm that learns the $\Phi$ matrix.

The \kw{Offline algorithm} performs multiple scans over the collection, calls \kw{ProcessDocument}
for each document $d \in D$ from the collection,
and then aggregates the resulting $(\hat n_{wt})$ matrices into the final $(n_{wt})$ matrix of size $|W| \times |T|$.
After each scan it recalculates $\Phi$ matrix according to the equation $\eqref{eq:Mstep:phi}$.

%To split collection into batches and process them concurrently is a common approach,
%introduced in AD-LDA algorithm \cite{newman09distributed}, and
%then further developed in PLDA \cite{wang09plda} and PLDA{+} \cite{liu11plda} algorithms.

At step \ref{alg:Offline:FormBatches} we split collection $D$ into batches $(D_b)$,
similarly to AD-LDA \cite{newman09distributed},
PLDA \cite{wang09plda} and PLDA{+} \cite{liu11plda} algorithms.
This step is not strictly necessary for the \kw{Offline algorithm},
and it rather reflects an internal implementation detail.
For performance reasons the outer loop over batches $b = 1, \dots, B$ is parallelized across multiple threads,
and within each batch the inner loop $d \in D_b$ is executed in a single thread.
Each batch is stored in a separate disk file on disk to allow out-of-core streaming of the collection.
For typical collections it is reasonable to have around $1000$ documents per batch,
however for ultimate performance we encourage users to experiment with this parameter.
Too small batches can cause disk IO overhead due to lots of small reads,
while too large batches will result in bigger tasks that will not be distributed evenly across computation threads.

Note that $\theta_{td}$ values appear only within $\kw{ProcessDocument}$ subroutine.
This leads to efficient memory usage because the implementation never stores the entire theta matrix at any given time.
Instead, $\theta_{td}$ values are recalculated from scratch on every pass through the collection.

Fig. \ref{fig:gantt:offline} illustrates a run-time behavior of the \kw{Offline algorithm}.
It shows a Gantt chart, where boxes correspond to the time spent in processing an individual batch.
The final box, executed on the main thread, correspond to the time spent in the step \ref{alg:Offline:Normalize}
to normalize $n_{wt}$ values and produce a new $\Phi$ matrix.

\section{Online algorithm}
\label{sec:Online}

The \kw{Online algorithm} (Fig. \ref{alg:Online}), originally suggested in \cite{hoffman10online},
improves the convergence rate of the \kw{Offline algorithm}
by re-calculating matrix $\Phi$ after every $\eta$ batches.
To simplify the notation
we introduce a trivial subroutine
\[
\kw{ProcessBatches}(\{D_b\}, \Phi) = \mathlarger\sum\limits_{D_b} \mathlarger\sum\limits_{d \in D_b} \; \kw{ProcessDocument}(d, \Phi) \\
\]
that aggregates the output of $\kw{ProcessDocument}$ across specific set of batches at a constant $\Phi$ matrix.
The algorithm is then given by Fig. \ref{alg:Online}.
Here the split of the collection $D := D_1 \sqcup D_2 \sqcup \dots \sqcup D_B$
into batches
plays far more significant role than in the \kw{Offline algorithm},
because different splitting algorithmically affects the result.
At step \ref{alg:Online:Merge} the new $n_{wt}^{i+1}$ values are calculated as a convex combination
of the old values $n_{wt}^{i}$ and the value $\hat n_{wt}^{i}$ produced on the recent batches.
Old counters $n_{wt}^{i}$ are discounted by a factor $(1 - \rho_i)$,
which depends on the iteration number. A common strategy is to use $\rho_i = (\tau_0 + i)^{-\kappa}$,
where typical values for $\tau_0$ are between $64$ and $1024$, for $\kappa$ --- between $0.5$ and $0.7$.

As in the \kw{Offline algorithm}, the outer loop over batches
$D_{\eta (i - 1) + 1}, \dots, D_{\eta i}$ is executed concurrently across multiple threads.
The problem with this approach is that all threads have no useful work to do during steps
\ref{alg:Online:Rho}-\ref{alg:Online:Normalize} of the \kw{Online algorithm}.
The threads can not start processing the next batches because a new version of $\Phi$ matrix is not ready yet.
As a result the CPU utilization stays low, and the run-time Gantt chart of the \kw{Online algorithm} typically looks like in Fig. \ref{alg:Online}.
The color indicate which version of the $p^i_{wt}$ matrix was used to process each batch
(orange for even $i$, yellow for odd $i$).
Blue box correspond to the time spend in merging $n_{wt}$ with $\hat n_{wt}$,
Green box is, as before, the time spent to normalize $n_{wt}$ values and produce a new $p_{wt}$ matrix.

In the next section we present an asynchronous non-blocking modification of the online algorithm that results in better CPU utilization.

\section{Asynchronous online algorithm}
\label{sec:AsyncOnline}

Asynchronous online algorithm is based on two new routines, \kw{AsyncProcessBatches} and \kw{Await}.
The first one is equivalent to \kw{ProcessBatches}, except that it just queues the task for an asynchronous execution and returns immediately.
Its output is a future object (for example, an \kw{std::future} from \kw{C++11} standard),
which can be later passed to $\kw{Await}$ in order to get the actual result, e.g. in our case the $\hat n_{wt}$ values.
In between calls to \kw{AsyncProcessBatches} and \kw{Await} the algorithm
can perform some other useful work, while the background threads are calculating the $\hat n_{wt}$ values.

The resulting algorithm is given by Fig. \ref{alg:AsyncOnline}.
To calculate $\hat n^{i+1}_{wt}$ it uses $\Phi^{i-1}$ matrix,
which is one generation older than $\Phi^{i}$ matrix used by the conventional \kw{Online algorithm} \ref{alg:Online}.
This adds an extra ``offset'' between the moment when $\Phi$ matrix is calculated and the moment when it is used,
and as a result gives the algorithm additional flexibility to distribute more payload to computation threads.
Steps \ref{alg:AsyncOnline:FirstStep} and \ref{alg:AsyncOnline:IfStatement} of the algorithm
are just technical tricks to implement the ``offset'' idea.

Adding an offset should negatively impact the convergence of the asynchronous algorithm \ref{alg:AsyncOnline}
comparing to the conventional algorithm \ref{Alg:Online}.
For example, in \kw{AsyncProcessBatches} the initial matrix $\Phi^0$ is used twice,
and the two last matrices $\Phi^{\lfloor B / \eta \rfloor - 1}$ and $\Phi^{\lfloor B / \eta \rfloor}$ will not be used at all.
%(except for $\Phi^{\lfloor B / \eta \rfloor}$ which forms the final result of the algorithm).
One the other hand the asynchronous algorithm gives better CPU utilization,
as clearly shown by the Gantt chart from Fig. \ref{fig:gantt:AsyncOnline}.
%The color scheme for the boxes is as in Fig. \ref{fig:gantt:AsyncOnline}.

This tradeoff convergence and CPU utilization is evaluated in the experiments from section \ref{sec:Experiments}.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:Architecture}

The challenging part for the implementation is to aggregate the $\hat n_{wt}$ matrices across multiple batches, given that they are processed in different threads.
The way BigARTM solves this challenge was changed between versions \kw{v0.6} (see Fig. \ref{fig:diagramm_artm_core}) and \kw{v0.7} (see Fig. \ref{fig:diagramm_artm_core_v07}).
In the old architecture the $\hat n_{wt}$ matrices were stored in a queue, and then aggregated by a dedicated \emph{Merger thread}.
This often caused performance bottlenecks, particularly because of small batches or due to a small number of iterations in \kw{ProcessDocument}'s inner loop 
\ref{alg:ProcessDocument:innerLoopBegin}-\ref{alg:ProcessDocument:innerLoopEnd}.

In the new architecture we removed Merger thread, and $\hat n_{wt}$ are written directly into the final $n_{wt}$ matrix
concurrently from all processor threads.
To synchronize the write access we require that
no threads simultaneously update the same row in $\hat n_{wt}$ matrix,
yet the data for distinct words can be written in parallel.
This is enforced by spin locks $l_w$, one per each word in the dictionary $W$.
At the end of \kw{ProcessDocument} we loop through all $w \in d$, acquire the corresponding lock $l_w$, append $\hat n_{wt}$ to $n_{wt}$ and release the lock.
This approach is similar to \cite{smola10architecture},
where the same pattern is used to update a shared stated in a distributed topic modeling architecture.

In our new architecture we also removed \emph{DataLoader} thread, which previously was loading batches from disk.
Now this happens directly from processor thread, which simplified the architecture without sacrificing performance.

In addition, we provided a cleaner API so now the users may use simple \kw{FitOffline}, \kw{FitOnline} methods to learn the model,
and $\kw{Transform}$ to apply the model to the data.
Previously the users had to interact with low-level building blocks, such as \kw{ProcessBatches} routine.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:Experiments}

Fig. \ref{fig:compare16} (\emph{Wikipedia} dataset) and Fig. \ref{fig:compare12} (\emph{Pubmed} dataset)
show the perplexity as a function of the time spend by the following four algorithms:
\kw{Offline algorithm} (Fig. \ref{alg:Offline}),
\kw{Online algorithm} (Fig. \ref{alg:Online}),
asynchronous online algorithm (Fig. \ref{alg:AsyncOnline}),
and the old non-deterministic online algorithm from \kw{BigARTM v0.6}, which is further described in Appendix \ref{sec:Appendix}.

Each point in the figures corresponds to a moment when the library finished a complete scan of the collection.
Each algorithm was given a fixed budget (60 minutes).
Lower perplexity means better result.

\section*{Appendix A}
\label{sec:Appendix}

TBD: describe non-deterministic online algorithm from \kw{BigARTM $v0.6$} and its gantt chart \ref{fig:gantt:oldonline}.

%Fig. \ref{fig:gantt:oldonline} illustrates how the old architecture was used to implement a non-deterministic online algorithm.

%TBD: explain how \ref{Online} is parallelized in the previous BigARTM version.
%Explain why it was non-deterministic.
%Explain that non-deterministic version has negative impact on convergence.
